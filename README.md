# Synnergy-Elysium
SIH25051 - Renewable Energy Monitoring System for Microgrids

# Team Elysium

# Built for SIH 2025 | Government of Odisha | Electronics & IT Department

## ðŸ“‹ Problem Statement
### Develop an IoT-based monitoring system for solar or wind microgrids in rural areas, providing real-time data on energy generation, storage, and consumption. 
### The system should alert users to inefficiencies or maintenance needs and improve microgrid efficiency by 15%


# Hardware (microgrid prototype)

### Typical components used in the prototype (adjust to your actual BOM):
### ESP32 development board for data acquisition and MQTT/HTTP transmission
### Current sensors (e.g., PZEM-004T,BH1750,INA219,Li-Ion Battery 3.7V 2500mAh,DC to DC Buck Converter,OLED Display,Solar Plate 6V 60mA,SD Card Module,Max17048) or hall-effect sensors
### Voltage sensing divider (for AC/DC measurement where required)
### Solar panel(s) and charge controller
### Battery (Li-ion / lead-acid) with BMS
### Wiring, connectors, prototyping board / enclosure
